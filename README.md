# Supermarket Sales Analysis - README
## Introduction
Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Analysis project! This project aims to explore and analyze historical sales data from a supermarket company. The dataset contains records from 3 different branches over a span of 3 months. The analysis is performed using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and the insights are visualized through interactive dashboards created using Tableau and Power BI.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is provided by Kaggle. 
Access the SuperMarket Analsysis Dataset from Kaggle using the link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales
It includes the following attributes:

	1. Invoice id: Computer-generated sales slip invoice identification number.
	2. Branch: Branch of the supercenter (identified by A, B, and C).
	3. City: Location of the supercenters.
	4. Customer type: Type of customers, recorded as "Members" for customers using member cards and "Normal" for customers without member cards.
	5. Gender: Gender type of the customer.
	6. Product line: General item categorization groups, including Electronic accessories, Fashion accessories, Food and beverages, Health and beauty, Home and 		lifestyle, Sports and travel.

	14. COGS: Cost of goods sold.
	15. Gross margin percentage: Gross margin percentage.
	16. Gross income: Gross income.
	17. Rating: Customer stratification rating on their overall shopping experience, on a scale of 1 to 10.
	18. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
In the EDA phase, we utilized Python to explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset. The analysis involved identifying missing values, handling outliers, calculating statistical measures, and gaining insights into various aspects of supermarket sales. The findings from EDA are used as the foundation for further visualizations.

## Tableau and Power BI Dashboards
To make the analysis more interactive and visually appealing, we created dynamic dashboards using both Tableau and Power BI. These dashboards allow users to explore the sales data through filters, drill-downs, and data-driven visualizations. The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of sales trends, customer preferences, and other valuable insights.

## How to Use the Dashboards
Access the Tableau and Power BI dashboards using the links provided below:

Once you access the dashboards, you can interact with the visualizations using various filters, such as branch, product line, date, customer type, and more.

Explore different tabs and charts to understand the sales patterns, popular product categories, and customer behavior.

Use the dashboards to gain valuable insights that can be used for business decisions, marketing strategies, and inventory management.

## Conclusion
The Supermarket Sales Analysis project provides a comprehensive understanding of historical sales data and customer behavior in the supermarket. The combination of Exploratory Data Analysis using Python and interactive dashboards created with Tableau and Power BI enables a deeper exploration of the dataset and facilitates data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to explore the dashboards and leverage the insights to enhance your understanding of supermarket sales dynamics. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
